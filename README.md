# CSIS293FA19
Test code for FA19 CSIS293 at Grossmont College

This program is an opportunity to test out how we can use GitHub to collaborate on a project. All students are going to submit their own pull requests and see what happens!

Edit favoriteMethods.java.  Each person can add in a method that they think is useful. It can be something new or something we've done in the past so add a method and then test it out.  When complete, we will have a file with many useful methods!
